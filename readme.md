# RISIKO

Very basic terminal implementation of the game Risiko.


Missing:

- Full Autocomplete for Territories DONE
- Form to stop Attack after each roll DONE
- Distinct Objectives
- Cards
- Reinforcement on multiple territories DONE
- Territories not at random at the start (maybe, too long to test)
